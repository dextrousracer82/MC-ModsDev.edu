# MCModsDev.edu

The goal of this website is to allow anybody to create minecraft bedrock mods (and hopfully java in the future) through a extremly simple step by step basis.

## The Idea
 
*the reason its "The Idea" is because its not built yet*

Our Idea is that anyone, even a kid, could learn to code minecraft mods.

### What It Would Have
 
- A lesson type basis
- In each "lesson" there would be text explaining the topic
- A checklist that would help you practice and let you move to the next lesson
- hopefully a video that was hand picked from exsisting tutorials or created by us
- hopfully some links to other websites like [wiki.bedrock.dev](https://wiki.bedrock.dev)

## Contribute

We are going to be creating those peices of text that explains the topic using MarkDown since its easy to use and widespread.
Also just helping with the website code by making a pull request is also cool!

## **Why?**

Our main creators hated the current Minecraft Bedrock marketplace, but thought that bedrock could have the same free quality mods, popularity, and documentation.
This is just a try to fix all that.
